Multi-Cycle RISCV Processor Core on FPGA 
    -Supports Register to Register, Immediate, Store, Branch, 
    Upper Immediate, and Jump Instructions 
    -Implemented into Finite State Machine with define states as:
        FETCH, DECODE, EXECUTE, READ MEMORY, WRITE MEMORY, WRITE_BACK
        
    Between these pipeline stages, we define various submodules:

    1. Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU)
        Fetches instructions from instruction memory based on PC. 
    2. Instruction Decode Unit (IDU)
        Decodes fetched instruction to determine instruction type, operands, immediate
    3. Register File (RF)
        Reads and Writes to register
    4. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
        Performs arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals, operands
    5. Memory Access Unit (MAU)
        Handles Data memory read and write operations
    6. Control Unit (CU)
        Generates control signals based on state and instruction
    7. Branch Unit (BU)
        Handles branch decisions, calculates branch addresses
    8. PC Update Unit (PC)
        Updates PC based on control signals, branch/jump decisions
